<h1>Hi, I'm Andrew! </h1>

I am a transitioning IT professional with a Bachelors of Science in Physics and 5+ years of working experience with electrical systems and access control security. 

I am a problem solver and leader with the ability to mesh together analytical reasoning and empathetic response to best fit any role within a team environment. I have completed and continually work on multiple cybersecurity/IT/system admin projects in order grow my learning everyday. 

𝗜𝗧 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗽𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗸– I have over 5 years of face-to-face customer service experience as an electrician's apprentice and access control technician. These roles served as the vital link between customer problems and solutions. My experience ranges from basic residential electrical system support through entire hospital access control and monitoring with IP cameras over private networks. These skills along with my communication ability will foster an easy transition into any Helpdesk position. 

𝐂𝐲𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 -With a passion for technology and the ethical duty to defend information from malicious attacks, I am focused on a career in Cybersecurity. It is my plan to grow and contribute to IT/Cybersecurity in a meaningful way so that future generations may have a more secure and predictable presence in the digital age.

𝗘𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗻'𝘀 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 – As an Electrician's Apprentice I have built, wired, and managed over 350 full wire rough-in circuiting in residential homes in the Detroit Metro area. My experience spans across all aspects of electrical wiring and troubleshooting including the use of power tools, multimeters, toner probes, punch down tools and crimpers. 

𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗻 – As an Access Control Technician I have installed and ran wire for multiple IP network cameras, access control keypads, motion detectors, and an entire school security system. My experience includes server rack termination, cable management, switch configuration, IP camera assignment, gate operators and beyond.

𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 – My education has allowed me not only to understand the laws that govern the universe but also the ability to take any complex system and solve for specific dependent variables. This reason is what drew me to Physics in the first place, to solve the most basic first principled questions humanity can raise. Along the way my interest in Physics never waivered but the realization that these methods for solving problems can be applied to almost any facet of life gave me inspiration.
