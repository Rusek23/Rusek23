<h1>Hi, I'm Andrew! </h1>

I am 31 years old, with a Bachelor's of Physics from Wayne State University, transitioning into the field of Information Technology.  I am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification which I plan to take in under a month.  I have been interested in technology from a young age and only recently have made the decision to follow that path into a career. Physics has primarily given the toolbox to understand and question problems while searching for first principles.  When it comes to Information Technology, I believe physics will gives me a competative edge for tackling the most complex and multidisciplinary problems.
